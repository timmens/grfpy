grfpy
=====

A Python wrapper for the grf (R) package.

Project Goal
------------

The goal of this project is to provide a full Python wrapper for the R package grf. At
the beginning I aim to fully wrap the R code using the rpy2 package. Perspectively I
will consider calling the respective Cpp code directly.
